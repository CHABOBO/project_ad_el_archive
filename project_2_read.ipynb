    "# METADATA\n",
    "Metadata for this project may be downloaded in CSV format. There are two different downloads available; the first, “Download details of ad airings on TV,” provides details about airings of ads on TV, giving information about when and where they aired. The second, “Download list of unique ads archive,” provides information on every ad archived by the project, whether or not that ad has been captured as airing on television. (For example, the ad may appear on a social media channel, such as youtube or snapchat.)\n",

To see ad on website, add prefix: “http://politicaladarchive.org/ad/” to archive_id and a forward slash at the end and paste resulting url into browser. For example,  polad_berniesanders_f0chv becomes http://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_berniesanders_f0chv/ Type: text.\n",

    "candidate = Candidate(s) named in ad; input by Internet Archive researchers. Type: text.\n",

    "type = Campaign ad, issue ad, unknown, input by Internet Archive researchers. Most ads in this archive are “campaign ads”–ads that are targeted toward particular candidates. However, some ads are “issue ads,” ads that cover “a national legislative issue of public importance.” Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules require that TV stations disclose ad buy contracts for both types of ads; therefore the Political TV Ad Archive includes such ads in this collection. Example: this ad on Puerto Rico debt. Type: text.\n",
    "\n",
    "message = Pro, con, mixed; input by Internet Archive researchers. Pro = ad mentions one or more candidates in positive way, no negative message about any candidate (Important: this applies only to candidates running in current election and race). Example: this ad sponsored by Donald Trump’s candidate committee mentions only him and does so in a positive way. Con = ad mentions one or more candidates in negative way. Example: this ad sponsored by the Right to Rise super PAC, which supports Jeb Bush, mentions only Marco Rubio and in a negative fashion. It includes references to “liberal Democrats” but none are candidates in the 2016 presidential race. Mixed: Any ad that mentions more than one candidate in particular race, with significant positive content about one or more candidates and negative content about one or more candidates. Example: this ad, sponsored by the Right to Rise Super PAC, criticizes Rubio but praises Jeb Bush.  Type: text.\n",

    "air_count = Total number of times this particular ad has aired, as captured by the Internet Archive in key primary states. Important: we capture all airings of ad, not just paid airings; if clip is replayed as part of a TV news broadcast, that will be represented in the count. Also, while this is a national total, it pertains only to the states the Internet Archive is tracking. A list of these states can be seen above. Type: number.\n",

Also: this count refers only to markets tracked by Internet Archive. Type: number.\n",

    "date_created = Date the Political TV Ad Archive counted first airing of this particular ad. Filter here to see what new ads the project has documented since viewing site previously. In other words, if  data are filtered for “February 10, 2016,” the viewer will see a list of ads first counted as airing on TV on that date; in this way, researchers can see which ads are new to the archive. Note: no dates exist before February 9, 2016, not because ads weren’t counted before then, but simply because that is the date this feature was added to the data. Type: date.\n",

    "Unique ads archived metadata\n",
    "In addition to detailing specific airings of ads on television, the Political TV Ad Archive also archives ads that are not showing up on television stations we are monitoring. There could be a number of reasons for this: for example, perhaps the ad is targeted for an online audience only; or perhaps the ad is airing in states or cities that the project is not monitoring. Another possibility is that the ad is airing on stations not captured by the project, such as local cable programs. Finally, perhaps an ad has not yet aired in key primary states that the project is tracking but will air in the future.\n",
    "The metadata in this download are similar to those in the ad airings metadata download. However, there are a few additional elements:\n",
    "reference_count = number of fact or source checks from our partner organizations for this particular ad. For example, the claim that Donald Trump once supported impeaching former President George W. Bush, contained in this ad sponsored by Our Principles PAC, a super PAC opposing Trump, was fact checked by PolitiFact, which rated it as “True.” The PolitiFact story is embedded on the Political TV Ad Archive page displaying the ad.

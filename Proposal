Can TV ads affect election results?

Proposal will include a quick write up about the datasets we will use
Political TV ad archive data 
detail total count(statistically significant?)
detail time of ads between 2015 and 2016?
detail candidates to review and how will group primary election data
Additional datasets: Number of electoral votes, number of popular votes, any form of numbers on the cost of tv ads
then move into analyses 
Owen would like to focus on correlations between positive and negative ad campaigns
Does the time of day have any correlation with negative or positive ad campaigns?
If possible find total paid media for vote
Elizabeth would like to explore creating geolocation and cluster data from the location information provided. Will need to find a package with coordinates of each city and state
Once created start to determine where the most republican and democratic tv ads are, divy up by region, state..
Also focus on when ads are happening and see, with visual, what ads are running at a certain time in the day. Will we find that republican ads happen mostly in the morning, will presidential ads only run in the evening?
Additionally of those campaigning was there an inverse reaction that as more positive tv ad campaigns were posted votes decreased?
